# About Me  

I am a B.Sc. Botany graduate with a CGPA of 9.20, driven by a passion for uncovering insights from data and applying analytical methods to solve real-world problems. While my academic foundation lies in the life sciences, my curiosity for data-driven decision making led me to pursue specialized training in analytics and business intelligence.  

üìö Business Analytics Certification (Analyst Club)  
I completed a Business Analytics certification with Analyst Club, an 8-week intensive program designed and taught by industry professionals, including consultants from Bain & Company.  

The program covered:  
- Core Analytical Tools: SQL for querying and cleaning datasets, Excel for data analysis and dashboards, and Power BI for visualization and storytelling.  
- Business Case Frameworks: Approaching problems like a consultant, structuring hypotheses, and presenting solutions in a business context.  
- Career Preparation: Resume building, LinkedIn profile optimization, and mock interviews specifically for data/business analytics roles.  
- Live Mentorship & Q&A: Weekly sessions and feedback from professionals, ensuring practical, industry-ready skills.  

This certification equipped me with a strong balance of technical skills (SQL, Excel, Power BI) and business acumen, enabling me to interpret data not just technically, but strategically.  

üíº Job Simulation Experience (Tata Group ‚Äì Forage)  
I also completed the Tata Group Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights job simulation, hosted via Forage. This self-paced program gave me the opportunity to step into the role of a business consultant and solve data problems in a real-world context.  

Key takeaways from this experience include:  
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Organizing raw data into usable structures for analysis.  
- Visualization Tools: Creating impactful dashboards and visuals using Power BI/Tableau.  
- Storytelling with Data: Presenting insights clearly and persuasively to leadership teams such as CEOs and CMOs.  
- Business Framing: Understanding how data insights tie into business outcomes and decision-making.  

This project sharpened my ability to not just analyze numbers, but communicate insights that drive action.  

üå± Leadership & Extracurricular Experience  
During my college days, I actively took up leadership roles that strengthened my teamwork, communication, and organizational skills:  
- Science Exhibition Leader: Led a 4-member group to showcase projects on Hydroponics and Terrarium Making, managing task delegation, presentation design, and coordination.  
- Community Awareness Initiative: Organized a Funfair Stall on Millet-Based Foods from the Botany Department to create awareness about the importance of millets in health and sustainability.  

These experiences not only nurtured my leadership and collaboration abilities but also taught me how to engage audiences and drive awareness campaigns effectively.  

üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Tools

- Power BI: Interactive reports, DAX measures, KPI tracking, business storytelling.

I have a strong online presence with 1,000+ followers on LinkedIn, where I engage with the analytics community, share my learnings, and showcase projects. This not only demonstrates my credibility, but also reflects my commitment to continuously grow and contribute to the data analytics ecosystem.
